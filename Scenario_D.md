Hello, **Dennis**! 

Glad to hear from you! 
As much as we want to help you with your concern, we strictly adhere to our [**course policy**](https://) that you have agreed on during the onboarding process.

Also, upon checking, we reached out last Tuesday regarding this matter and haven't received a response from you. Anyway, you don't need to worry as you will still have lifetime access to the course material provided that you'll use the GitHub signed up for CodePath. 

 We ask for your understanding of this matter. 

Thank you so much, and stay healthy! 

**Kind regards,**
CodePath.org Team

### Good day, **John**! 

Thank you so much for reaching out to us. 
I understand how you feel. However, please know that we qualify students based on their technical interview skills. 
Rest assured that we want you to get the best experience possible. Given that said, we gauge every student well, and we don't want anyone to be put into a class that's either too advanced or too basic for them. 

Moving forward, I attached here the following important date for your Intermediate track program.

**Important Dates:**
* Start Date: **June 7th**
* End Date: **August 21st**

Thank you for your understanding. 
 
#### **All the best,**
CodePath.org Team

### Good day, **Anne**! 

I hope this mail finds you well. 

We are very sorry that you missed our deadline.
As mentioned, our class is already complete at the moment. 
We are deeply saddened whenever we encounter such a situation as we are trying to make our courses available to many people.

In the meantime, I would like to share our [high-level software interview guide](https://) that might help you in your venture. 

Also, I want to invite you to **sign up** for our mailing list to update you if there are future courses or virtual events you might be interested in. 

Thank you for your understanding. 

#### **All the best,**

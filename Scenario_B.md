#### Hello, **Jane!**

I hope everything is okay with you and your family. 

I do appreciate your effort and interest in joining our program here in CodePath.org.  
At the moment, our courses are specifically targeted at students enrolled in our partner universities within the United States as also indicated in our [eligibilty checks](https://) section.
However, please know that we are working on to expanding are programs to many more areas. 
Actually, we already run programs in other countries such as Haiti. 

To get the most recent update, please **sign up** for our [mailing list](https://) so that we can notify you once classes become available in your area powered by local organizers or through remote means.

In the meantime, there are a lot of resources out there for people interested in learning Android, and weâ€™ve done some work to make them more accessible. We have many [online resources for learning Android](https://) including an extensive [list of Android resources online.](https://)

We are looking forward to be able to bring programs to your area and expand our audience for future programs. 

Thank you for your understanding. 

#### All the best,
CodePath.org Team
